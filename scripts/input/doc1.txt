Money & Career (Reversed)
In a career context, the Wheel of Fortune reversed signifies a career becoming stagnant or a period of disruption and uncertainty in your career. Again, this Major Arcana card in reverse can show unwelcome changes coming. You must assess the decisions you’ve made about your career and honesty ask yourself if they have been the right choices to help you achieve what you want to get out of life. Have you seized the opportunities that were available to you? If not, don’t beat yourself up over it. Know that your current setbacks are only temporary. Use this time to learn from past mistakes and position yourself to seize your moment when the Wheel swings upwards again. Financially, don’t gamble or take financial risks when the Wheel of Fortune is in a reversed position. If you are feeling the pinch financially, this trump card can signify that you have neglected to put money aside or build yourself a financial safety net. Your current hardship will not last forever, when your finances improve, carry the lessons from this time forward with you.
Health (Reversed)
In a health context, Wheel of Fortune reversed can indicate that you may be finding upheaval or disruption in another area of your life is having a knock on effect on your health. Try to remain positive and avoid letting pessimism take over. While change can be stressful, especially unwelcome change, remember that even if you can’t control the situation, you can control how you let it affect you. Don’t try to stop events from happening but make positive steps to take care of yourself and your body even through the tough times and your health will benefit.
Spirituality (Reversed)
In a spiritual context, you may feel like the universe is working against you and nothing is going your way with the Wheel of Fortune reversed. This may be testing your faith but even through our darkest days, the universe has a plan for us all. Don’t lose faith! Instead use this time to deepen your connection to your higher self. This trouble will pass, try not to resist the changes it brings and you will come out a more connected spiritual person.
  - Justice

Upright Meaning Guide
Justice Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Justice, karmic justice, consequences, legal disputes, law, truth, honesty, integrity, cause and effect, life lessons
Ad ends in 15
General Meaning and Interpretation (Upright)
The Justice Tarot card relates to karmic justice, legal matters and cause and effect. In a general context Justice is showing you that all actions have consequences. So look at your present circumstances in that context, how have your own actions contributed to where you find yourself today? Are there any karmic lessons that you should be learning from your current situation? This Major Arcana card is also a signifier of legal matters being resolved in a fair and balanced matter. This is usually a favourable omen if you are involved in a legal dispute. Justice is concerned with truth and integrity, so you may find yourself compelled to speak the truth and that you more than ever value honesty and integrity in others. Justice also relates to balance. It may signify that circumstances may arise that could throw you off balance. These circumstances may or may not be beyond your control or of your own making. Either way, you must try to keep yourself on an even-keel as events unfold. The Justice card can also indicate that you have a choice to make when it appears in your Tarot readings as you will be weighing up all your options and balancing the scales.
Love & Relationships (Upright) 
In a love Tarot reading, if you are single, Justice can indicate a relationship with a person in the legal industry (judge, lawyer, legal secretary etc.) It is the Tarot card that corresponds to Libra, so a Libra may be coming into your life. If you have treated others with integrity and kindness and not been treated well in return in relationships, Justice in a love tarot reading can indicate that this imbalance is about to be corrected with the loving partner you deserve coming into your life. It can also signify that those who have treated you badly will get their comeuppance. If you are in a relationship, whether Justice is a good or bad omen really depends on the behaviour of you and your partner. If you are both being honest and acting with integrity in your relationship then you will see the rewards in the form of a period of harmony or a bigger commitment. It can indicate marriage, representing the marriage contract. However, if either of you have been dishonest or have cheated, Justice indicates that the truth will be revealed and whoever has been dishonest will reap what they have sown.
Money & Career (Upright)
When Justice appears in a career context, it tells you that you need to pay attention to balancing your work and personal life. Don’t forget to take adequate time out for yourself. Career is important. We all need to be able to financially support ourselves and there’s nothing wrong with having ambition. At same time, consider how many people on their deathbeds think “I wish I’d spent more time at the office.”? Remember to make time for the people who are important to you and for yourself while you’re building and maintaining a career you can be proud of. Financially, Justice can literally show you balancing your books and is a reminder that if you behave with integrity in terms of money and business you will be rewarded. If you’re going to take a bit of a gamble on something, this card is a good omen.
Health (Upright)
If you’ve been having health issues, Justice can indicate that you are out of balance which is contributing to your health issues. It also cautions against overindulgence in any area of your life. Try to keep everything in moderation.
Spirituality (Upright)
In a spiritual context, one of the main themes of Justice is karma. This does not mean that you are being punished for past mistakes. It means that you have chosen to learn certain lessons in this lifetime and the universe is sending you those lessons. The sooner you learn these lessons the better off you’ll be.

Reversed Meaning Guide
Justice Reversed Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Injustice, karmic retribution, dishonesty, corruption, lack of accountability, dishonesty, unfairness, karmic avoidance
General meaning and interpretation (Reversed)
In a general context, Justice reversed can indicate injustice or avoidance of karmic justice. This may take the form of being treated unjustly in your life or situation where you are being unfairly affected by the choices or actions of others. You may feel you are being victimised or blamed for something that is not your fault. Whatever the situation, you must try to maintain your balance. Even if you didn’t create the situation, you can choose how you react to it and that can be a lesson in itself. Justice in a reversed position can also be an indicator of someone trying to avoid their karma. If you have played a part in creating your current situation by bad choices or actions, you must be accountable. Don’t try to blame others or avoid the consequences, just learn from it and move forward a little wiser and more self-aware. The Justice Tarot card reversed can also indicate dishonesty. If you have been caught out in a lie, don’t try to justify it or lie your way out of it. Just confess, accept the consequences and try to draw a line under it. Justice reversed can indicate someone with very hard-line or uncompromising views. Examine if you or those around you may have become prejudiced. Examine this and determine is this how you want to be or what you want in your life? If you are involved in a legal dispute, it is not a favourable card to get and indicates that there will be some form of injustice in the outcome or the outcome will not be what you had hoped for.
Love & Relationships (Reversed)
In a love context, if you are in a relationship Justice reversed can be a strong indicator of being caught out in a deception or cheating. So if you have been cheating on your partner or lying to them, expect big repercussions. You may also find that any arguments between you and your partner seem endless with this Major Arcana trump card in your Tarot reading. It can also be a sign that you feel you are not being treated fairly or as an equal in the relationship. Before you go casting judgements on your partner, examine your own role in the relationship and ask yourself if you are being fair by apportioning the blame to your partner. If you assess your relationship issues and feel you are blameless, you should still try to learn from the situation. Remember, we teach people how to treat us and what we put up with, we end up with! If you are single, Justice reversed can indicate that while you may feel you are ready for the relationship you deserve, you have still not learned the lessons from your past relationships that are necessary for you to move forward and avoid repeating the same mistakes. It can also indicate that you tend to lack balance in relationships and this maybe causing your relationships to flounder. We all get caught up in the initial excitement of new love but be careful not lose yourself completely! Try to maintain a balance between you love life and your own independent life when you meet someone, it will give your relationships the space they need to grow. If you have treated past partners badly, Justice reversed can be a sign that you may be suffering the consequences of your actions.
Money & Career (Reversed)
In a career context, Justice reversed may indicate that you are being treated unfairly in work. Perhaps you are being blamed for others mistakes or shortcomings. Perhaps you feel others are trying to sabotage you. Whatever the issue, don’t be hasty in your reaction. It is better to hold back and take a logical approach to resolve the issue. Don’t charge in and confront the culprits as with justice in reverse, arguments are not likely to go in your favour. Justice in reversed can also indicate that if you have not been acting with integrity in your career, your behaviour may be coming back to bite you. It can be a sign of corruption in business. Don’t try to avoid the consequences but hold your hands up and learn from your mistakes. You will be more respected for it. Justice reversed can also be a stronger indicator of a lack of work/life balance than the upright card, so be mindful of putting too much emphasis on either your work or personal life when this Major Arcana card appears in your reading. Financially, avoid risky investments or gambles as you are not likely to be in luck with this card appearing. It can indicate injustice in relation to money so be very cautious of people you are doing financial deals with at the moment, they may not be trustworthy!
Health (Reversed)
Again in a health context, Justice reversed indicates a need for balance but it’s a stronger indicator that a lack of balance may cause health issues. Try to make time to take care of yourself and avoid overindulgence.
Spirituality (Reversed)
As with the upright Tarot card, Justice reversed in a spiritual context tell us that the universe may be sending you the lessons you are supposed to learn in this life. The reversed position indicates that you may be trying to avoid these life lessons or outright refusing to accept them. Our life lessons usually start off small, giving us the opportunity to learn without having to go through turmoil or massive upheaval. However, if we do not learn or refuse to learn, the universe will keep bringing these lessons back to us in bigger and more consequential ways. You can avoid this by simply learning the lessons quickly. In a reversed position, Justice can also mean you feel you are being treated unjustly. Try to use this time to connect to your higher self and rise above your circumstances.


  - The Hanged Man
Upright Meaning Guide
The Hanged Man Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Feeling trapped, confined, self-limiting, uncertainty, lack of direction, needing release, letting go
Ad ends in 9
 
General Meaning and Interpretation (Upright)
In a general context, The Hanged Man Tarot card indicates that you are in a situation that you are not happy with. You may be feeling like you are stuck in a rut or trapped in a situation or frame of mind that is not making you happy but you have the power to release yourself. This may involve walking away from the situation or simply changing your perspective on it. The Hanged Man may also signify that you may be facing a dilemma and are unsure of what path to take. You may feel that things are not turning out the way you planned with this Major Arcana card appearing in your Tarot spread. You need to step outside yourself and look at your situation from a different angle. Give yourself time to just relax, stop trying to control things and just let them be, the correct course of action will become clear to you in time.
Love & Relationships (Upright) 
In a love Tarot context if you are in a relationship, The Hanged Man indicates that you may be unhappy with the way your relationship is going at the moment. It can also signify that either you or your partner may be feeling the need to take a step back from the relationship to assess your options or where you want the relationship to lead. The Hanged Man tells you to hold off on making any decisions and just give yourself time to think things through. You may need to rethink your perceptions of what your relationship should be like and focus on the positive aspects of the relationship as it is instead of worrying about what it isn’t. Alternatively, if you find that you are truly unhappy, The Hanged Man appearing in your Tarot reading tells you that you are the only one keeping yourself in this situation. You can walk away if you want to. If you are single, The Hanged Man can indicate that you need to release yourself from situations, ideas or people that do not make you happy. This may involve releasing old negative relationship patterns. If you have been holding on to your feelings for an ex, The Hanged Man tells you it’s time to release those feelings. It may also signify that you need to release any rigid preconceptions about your ideal partner in order to open yourself up to the options around you.
Money & Career (Upright)
In a career context The Hanged Man indicates that you are feeling uncertain about your career path or feel like your career has become stagnant. You may be unclear about what steps you need to take to move your career forward. If you are struggling to make a decision, understand that you don’t have to make a decision right now. Just relax and let things unfold. Things will become clearer in time. If you’re having financial issues, The Hanged Man indicates that you need a fresh perspective. Maybe anxiety around your finances is making them seem worse than they actually are or there may be positive things happening for you in other areas that you are not appreciating because you are focusing too much on money.
Health (Upright)
If you have been experiencing health issues, The Hanged Man encourages you to consider all of your treatment options. This does not mean you should reject the treatment you’ve been offered but it tells you to rethink your health issues and consider tackling them from multiple angles. It can also indicate that whatever the issue you are experiencing, you may need to just allow yourself time to heal rather than becoming frustrated that your health is not improving as quickly as you want it to.
Spirituality (Upright)
In a spiritual context, The Hanged Man tells you to be mindful of your attitude to yourself. If you have been engaging negative thinking you need to stop this as it is may affect your outcome as well as how you feel about your life. Don’t allow yourself to get bogged down spiritually. If you release old beliefs or negative thoughts that don’t work for you anymore, you will find that whole new spiritual worlds will open up to you and free you up to connect to your higher consciousness.

Reversed Meaning Guide
The Hanged Man Reversed Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Discontentment, apathy, disinterest, stagnation, impulsiveness, negative patterns, detachment 
General meaning and interpretation (Reversed)
The Hanged Man reversed can indicate that you are being impulsive and making rash decisions as a way to distract yourself from some sort of inner discontentment. This Major Arcana trump card generally shows that you may be jumping from one bad situation to the next without considering where this behaviour is taking you. Ask yourself if there are feelings you trying to avoid confronting or changes that you know need to be made but are reluctant to tackle. If there are, consider what you fear will happen if you do? If you genuinely don’t know what to do in terms of your direction in life, just stop, breathe and wait for things to become clearer. However, if you know your behaviour patterns are not working for you, change them. Your attitude towards your life will determine life’s attitude towards you!
Love & Relationships (Reversed)
If you are single, The Hanged Man in a reversed position can indicate that you have been repeating the same negative relationship patterns over and over without learning from your mistakes. You may be rushing from bad relationship to the next and never taking responsibility for the role you play in choosing these relationships. Try to slow down, figure out why this pattern keeps continuing and what you need to resolve within yourself to change it. If you are in a relationship, The Hanged Man can indicate that your relationship may not be working but you or your partner may be holding onto it for fear of being alone or starting over. It can also indicate that the relationship could be salvageable but you are not currently prepared to confront the issues you are experiencing.
Money & Career (Reversed)
In a work context, The Hanged Man reversed Tarot card indicates that things may not be going well but you have neither the will nor inclination to deal with the issues involved. You may be resorting to blaming others or feeling like you are powerless to change your circumstances. Now is the time to take back control of your career. Figure out what you want and go for it, don’t be a passenger in your own life especially if it’s not taking you where you want to go. Financially, this Major Arcana card can indicate that you are paralysed by your fear of financial hardship. If you are struggling to cope financially, consider seeking financial advice from a professional. A fresh perspective might be all you need to get things moving in the right direction.
Health (Reversed)
If you have been having health issues, The Hanged Man in a reversed position tells you that you really need to think outside the box to resolve them. You may consider the possibility that issues in other areas of your life may be aggravating or even causing your health issues. For example, stress, grief and anxiety can physically manifest themselves in a whole host of symptoms like migraines, insomnia, poor concentration, chronic fatigue, skin conditions and the list goes on. Alternative and holistic therapies could compliment your current medical treatment, boost your healing and help resolve any issues that may be exasperating your health woes.
Spirituality (Reversed)
In a spiritual context, The Hanged Man Tarot card reversed indicates that you may have lost your way spiritually. You may be seeking gratification in shallow ways rather than connecting to your higher self. Reversed, The Hanged Man is a stronger indicator of old beliefs not working for you anymore. Now would be a good time for you to explore new spiritual paths. Engaging with a new path may lift you out of a spiritual slump and leave you with a renewed connection to your higher consciousness.


  - Death

Upright Meaning Guide
Death Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Spiritual transformation, new beginnings, letting go, endings, change, transition, sudden or unexpected upheaval
Ad ends in 15
General Meaning and Interpretation (Upright)
Although it is the Tarot card that many people fear, Death generally does not mean physical death. As a rule you should never predict deaths (or the outcomes of illnesses or pregnancies for that matter) as a Tarot reader. It is unethical and irresponsible. Aside from the ethics, The Death Tarot Card usually signifies spiritual transformation and a time of change and new beginnings, not actual death! The transformation or change that Death can bring can be difficult, unexpected, sudden or even traumatic but it will bring with it a new lease of life. Its best to try not to resist the change the Death Tarot card brings as resisting it will only make the transition difficult and painful. Instead try to embrace the change as a fresh start. This Major Arcana card can also signify the need to let go of old issues or beliefs when it appears in a Tarot spread. It may be telling you that you need to draw a line under the past in order to move forward in a positive direction. A Death card transformation can be a bit of a shock to the system but ultimately it’s a positive one.
Love & Relationships (Upright) 
If you are in a relationship, Death in a love tarot context can signify that you or your partner may be holding onto a relationship that’s not working or you may be clinging to old patterns that are stopping your relationship from moving forward. Death signifies that things are going to change whether you want them to or not. You can either resist the change or embrace it. If your relationship is not going well, the Death Tarot card can indicate that it may be time to walk away, it can indicate divorce or it can indicate that you and your partner need to make big changes and let go of old patterns or issues to make it work. The old issues the Death card seeks to change can be deep seated and painful. If that’s the case, you may want to consider relationship counselling. The outcome really depends on whether or not you and your partner are both willing to embrace the transformation and really want the relationship to survive because you love each other rather than because you fear not being in the relationship. The changes the Death Tarot card can bring to a relationship can be positive too, it can indicate an unexpected change like a surprise engagement or a pregnancy, you may find these changes overwhelming initially. If you are single, the Death card can indicate that you will soon be casting off the old beliefs, issues or behaviours that are no longer useful to you. Embrace this transformation as it will bring new love into your life.
Money & Career (Upright)
Death in a career context is a warning not to get too dependent on anything that is not working for you. The only thing in life that is guaranteed is that things change. If you are unhappy in your current job, start looking for a new one or the universe may force you to find a new job. If you are starting your own business but have been reluctant to quit your old job because of the security it offers, Death may be indicating that’s it’s time to consider jumping in with both feet. Money can be tightening when the Death card appears in a financial context, you may have a sudden drop in income or loss of money. If that happens don’t let it get you down, this change will lead you somewhere positive and you will learn from it. If you experience financial hardship, don’t stick your head in the sand, make practical adjustments and keep moving forward in a positive way. If you are tight on money, consider getting back to basics, swap big nights out for cosy nights in with close friends. And remember, any financial issues will be fine in the long run if you make the changes necessary.
Health (Upright)
Don’t panic if you see the Death card in health reading, again the Death card only indicates physical death in extremely rare cases and only in certain combinations! If you have been feeling like your health is never going to improve, Death can signify that a change is coming. However, how you handle this change will go a long way to determining the outcome. If your health has been bad and illness has left you feeling pessimistic, try to embrace the coming changes by changing your attitude. Try to find something positive in each day even if you feel ill. You may also try a new approach that you haven’t tried before like a different diet, holistic therapy or energy healing. Know that your current state is temporary, it will change.
Spirituality (Upright)
Physical death is a form of transformation when our spirits leave the physical body behind and transform back to the spiritual beings we all are intrinsically. The Death card represents spiritual transformation. In a spiritual Tarot reading, it indicates a time where you can deeply connect to your higher self and discover a depth of spirituality that you may not have even known you possessed. This spiritual transformation may be brought about by grief or loss or heartbreak that you have experienced. It can represent a difficult transition from an old situation to a new beginning. Try to embrace the change even if it is difficult, it’s leading you to your higher path.

Reversed Meaning Guide
Death Reversed Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Inability to move forward, fear of beginnings, repeating negative patterns, resisting change, dependency
General meaning and interpretation (Reversed)
In a general context, Death reversed indicates that you are resisting a change that is necessary for you to move forward. Nothing new can begin while you are holding on to this old negative energy. Death indicates that while you are finding it difficult to let go, once you do, new energy will come into your life to give you a new brighter beginning. The change the Death Tarot card reversed brings is not something you can resist forever, if you keep holding onto the things you should be letting go of, the universe will find a way to push you on to your life path in its own way. The universe’s way of getting you to where you’re supposed to be, if you resist it, can be shocking and distressing. It’s much better to make you way to your correct path rather than getting a jolt that forces you onto it. At least if you make a decision to let go of old situations, old issues or relationships you will feel empowered that you made a decision to end what wasn’t working for you. When you think of the change you are resisting, ask yourself realistically is it going to make you feel worse than staying in your current situation indefinitely or could it possibly lead you to something amazing?
Love & Relationships (Reversed)
If you are in a relationship, the Death Tarot card reversed in a love tarot reading, is a strong indicator that you are resistant to a change in your relationship. You may be holding on to a relationship that has long since run its course because you feel dependent on your partner or are terrified of loneliness. Or you may be staying with a partner who you no longer love out of a sense of obligation. It can also indicate that a relationship that you thought was finished long ago could resurface and rekindle. If you are single, Death reversed is a strong indicator that you need to let go of negative behaviour patterns in order to bring something positive into your love life. For example, if you have a tendency to pick bad partners due to low self-esteem you will need to build your self-confidence and let go of your self-sabotaging behaviours in order to allow a partner in to your life who will treat you with love and respect.
Money & Career (Reversed)
Like the upright meaning, The Death Tarot card reversed is an indicator that now might be time for a career change or new direction. You may be resistant to this change because you are afraid to let go of the security you have. You may like the stability and routine your career brings even if you find it unfulfilling. You may have been engaging in behaviour patterns that have stopped you from getting to where you want to be. Take time to figure out what needs to change in order to get you to the place on the career ladder you want to be and make it happen. Financially, much like the upright meaning, when this Major Arcana card appears reversed in a Tarot spread, it tell you that a financial deterioration of some sort may be inevitable and you will need to rethink how you manage your finances to get through it. Have a rethink of your spending habits, are there ways you have been wasting money that could improve your ability to manage your finances that you are resisting? Maybe you could be eliminating debt but you overspend out of habit? Let go of bad financial practices and be responsible with your money. Any hardship will only be temporary if you manage your money carefully.
Health (Reversed)
In a health context, Death reversed can be an indicator that you are resisting tackling your health issues or being proactive in your treatments. Maybe your health woes are physical symptoms of a deeper issue and you are resisting resolving that. Maybe you have old fears surrounding a particular type of illness and you’ve been avoiding check-ups as a result. Go and get it out of the way, it will give you renewed energy.
Spirituality (Reversed)
When Death reversed appears in a spiritual context, like the upright meaning, it signifies spiritual transformation brought about by a difficult time, grief or loss in your life. However, the reversed card in a Tarot reading indicates that you are extremely resistant to this change. Maybe you are so upset with the upheavals you’ve experienced that you’re digging your heels in refusing to go forward. You may have lost faith in the universe and think that there is nothing positive in your future. Or you may be angry and feel like nothing the universe could bring you now could make up for what you’ve been through. It is ok to feel like this, allow yourself to feel how you feel but remember digging your heels in and being determined to stay in a state of unhappiness is only going to hurt you. Try to have some faith that the spirit world is there for you and loving and guiding you even if you’re too upset to know it right now. Just start putting one foot in front of the other and you’ll end up somewhere better.


  - Temperance

Upright Meaning Guide
Temperance Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Balance, peace, patience, moderation, inner calm, perspective, tranquillity, harmonious relationships, soulmates
General Meaning and Interpretation (Upright)
In a general context, the Temperance Tarot card signifies balance, peace, patience and moderation. This Major Arcana card indicates that you have found your inner calm and have a good perspective on things. It is a sign that the relationships in your life are harmonious. You have learned not to allow yourself to be dragged into other people’s conflict or to let minor issues knock you off balance. Instead you adapt to the situations with a clear mind and calm heart and keep your balance. Temperance can also signify that you have found peace and tranquillity and you are feeling content. Temperance indicates that you are truly in touch with who you are inside, what you value and your own moral compass and you are finding it easier to figure out your aspirations and set yourself goals.
Love & Relationships (Upright) 
In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Temperance Tarot card is one of the best cards you can get. It signifies a harmonious relationship where you and your partner find the perfect balance of love, commitment and respect. It is also a signifier of soulmates. If you have been having relationship problems, Temperance is an indicator that you will both resolve whatever issues have been holding your relationship back in order to move forward together. If you are single, Temperance is an indicator that you will be learning to balance the other areas of your life in order to make room for a loving partner to come into your life. Once you have done this you will attract the right partner to you.
Money & Career (Upright)
In a career context, Temperance tells you that now, is a great time to set goals as you have the patience and persistence to achieve what you want. Your hard work and dedication will be noticed with Temperance upright in your Tarot spread. If you are hoping for a promotion or career advancement, Temperance tells you to be patient and not to jump at the first opportunity if there is a chance for something better further down the line. In a financial context, things should be going well as you should have balanced finances. However, be careful to practice moderation in relation to money as now is a time to maintain the balance and build your savings up at a steady pace rather than take risks with money or make risky investments.
Health (Upright)
In a health context, the Temperance Tarot card indicates that moderation is the key to good health so if you need to get any unhealthy habits under control, you will find that now is a great time to do it. If you have been experiencing any health issues, look to the areas of your life or health where you have been overdoing it or under-doing it. Bringing balance these areas may give you the healing boost you need.
Spirituality (Upright)
In a spiritual context, Temperance tells you to listen to your inner guidance and is an indicator that your spirit guides are all around you. Temperance can also signify that you are finding the right balance between your mind, body and spirit. Remember to have patience as you follow your spiritual path and know that everything is happening at the pace it is meant to.

Reversed Meaning Guide
Temperance Reversed Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Imbalance, self-indulgence, excess, clashing, lack of perspective, discord, antagonism, recklessness, hastiness
General meaning and interpretation (Reversed)
In a general context, Temperance reversed indicates imbalance or overindulgence. This Major Arcana card can be an indicator that you are behaving in a hasty or reckless fashion. It can be a signifier of many issues with excessive or harmful indulgences such as drinking, drug use, gambling, overeating, shopping and the list goes on. The Temperance Tarot card in a reversed position may be telling you that you have lost touch with your own inner calm and tranquillity which can lead you to seek gratification in risky, harmful ways. Temperance reversed can also indicate a lack of harmony with the people in your life so you may find yourself clashing with those closest to you or allowing yourself to be dragged into other people’s drama. You may be lacking perspective and not looking at the bigger picture. You would do well to take a step back and take a look at how you are behaving, examine the root causes and work on resolving them.
Love & Relationships (Reversed)
In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship, Temperance reversed can indicate conflict and clashes caused by an imbalance in the relationship. This may be a result of one of you feeling like you care more than the other or feeling like the love and respect you show your partner is not reciprocated. There is a lack of harmony in the relationship and you may find that you are arguing with each other, that you’re not willing to listen to each other. You may also find yourselves being outright antagonistic with each other and trying to point score rather than working together to resolve your issues. Try to calm the situation down and find your own inner balance so that you can better cope with the issues you are facing and make yourself more open to finding solutions. If you are single, Temperance reversed can indicate that you are giving too much of yourself too soon to the people you’re interested in. This can be simply that you’re trying too hard or coming across as too eager or it can indicate promiscuity or coming across as completely desperate! Try to be patient if you’re looking for love. Don’t be hasty or try to force a relationship before you’ve gotten to know someone properly. Just relax, try to find your own inner balance and let any new romance develop at its own pace.
Money & Career (Reversed)
In a career context, the Temperance Tarot card reversed can signify an imbalance or conflict in a work situation. You may be working too hard or not working hard enough or you could be clashing with your co-workers. It can also indicate that you are ignoring or reacting negatively to constructive criticism. Whatever the issue, you need to look inward to re-balance your own energy in order to resolve this situation. Financially, if you are having issues you need to nip them in the bud immediately. Watch out for impulsive spending as you find yourself looking for instant gratification to distract you from the imbalance you’re feeling inside. You need to slow down and reconnect with yourself to find peace. Excessive spending will bring you debt, not inner tranquillity!
Health (Reversed)
Temperance reversed in a health context is a very strong indicator that you are out of balance in some areas of your life that are having a knock on effect on your health. The Temperance Tarot card reversed can also be a sign of unhealthy or harmful excesses when it appears in a Tarot spread so be mindful of what you are putting into your body at this time. You need to connect to how you are feeling, figure out what issues may be causing you to seek comfort in unhealthy ways and resolve those issues to bring your balance back.
Spirituality (Reversed)
In spiritual terms, Temperance reversed tells you that you are spiritually imbalanced. You may feel like you have lost your connection to your inner guidance or your spirit guides. It is also an indicator of an imbalance between mind, body and soul. You should consider doing some energy work and meditation to bring you back into balance. You may want to consider seeking the help of a professional, if you are finding self-balancing is not working for you at the moment.

Upright Meaning Guide
The Devil Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Addiction, depression, mental health issues, secrecy, obsession, cheating, dependency, bondage, materialism, sesxuality, powerlessness, hopelessness, abuse, violence, assault
Ad ends in 14
General Meaning and Interpretation (Upright)
In a general context, The Devil Tarot card can signify depression or addiction. It can also be a sign of feeling trapped or restricted. With this Major Arcana card in your Tarot spread you may feel as though outside influences or forces beyond your control are restricting you, leaving you feeling powerless and victimised. However, this is the illusion The Devil creates. You are in control of your own destiny and are not bound by anything other than your own attitudes and behaviour. Don’t give up and don’t give away your power. You don’t have to tolerate negativity, criticism, manipulation or abuse from anyone. There are always options and there is always something positive you can do to improve your situation no matter how hopeless things may seem on the surface. Likewise be mindful of how you are treating others and make sure you are not trying to manipulate or control people in your life either. The Devil upright in your Tarot reading can also indicate obsessive, secretive or impulsive behaviour. It can be a sign that you are out of control. The Devil Tarot card is also a signifier of materialism and may show that you have become overly concerned with material things, status or power. These are not things that will make you truly fulfilled as a person so put your energy into the things that will.
Love & Relationships (Upright) 
If you are in a relationship, The Devil can be a sign that you or your partner are feeling trapped. It may indicate a loss of freedom brought on by becoming too engrossed in a relationship. The Devil shows that this level of co-dependence is unhealthy. You and your partner should take a step back and try to rediscover some interests outside the relationship. It can also signify that you or your partner may be suffering from mental health issues that are affecting the relationship. If this is the case, seek the help of a professional counsellor to assist you both during this time. The Devil Tarot card can be a sign of jealousy, envy, deception, dominance, cheating and in an extremely negative context abuse, violence or sexual assault. Look to supporting cards to confirm this. If you feel trapped in a relationship because of any form of abuse, remember you can free yourself of this situation, don’t let The Devil make you feel powerless. If you are single, The Devil can indicate sex without love. You may be having unfulfilling or even dangerous sexual encounters or allowing yourself to be used by people who do not care about you because you desperately want to be loved. If that is the case, take a break from dating until you’ve built up your self-esteem. The Devil can also be an indicator of a potential relationship that may be harmful to you. This new love interest may have a drug addiction, become overly dependent on you possibly as a result of mental health issues, be deceptive or become violent or abusive. Although they may seem intriguing or exciting at first, The Devil indicates danger, so avoid letting this person into your life.
Money & Career (Upright)
In a career context, The Devil upright in your Tarot reading can indicate that you feel trapped in a job that you hate. Again, you are in control of your own life even if you don’t feel that way. Evaluate what you really want in your career and if a move is what you need, make it. Remember that it is a choice you are making if you decide to stay in a job you dislike. The Devil can also indicate a colleague or person in a career context who is deceptive and may be trying to sabotage you. Be careful who you trust, this person will be all smiles to your face and while simultaneously stabbing you in the back. In a financial context, The Devil indicates that money will be tight but it suggests that there is more you could be doing to help yourself. Watch your spending! It can easily get out of control with The Devil in your Tarot spread. Also, avoid gambling or any sort of risky or impulsive investments.
Health (Upright)
In a health context, The Devil can indicate poor health brought about by harmful behaviour such as drug addiction, alcoholism or compulsive overeating. It is also an indicator of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, panic attacks, bipolar, schizophrenia etc. If you feel like you have a mental health problem, please do not look to the cards to diagnose you, seek the help of a mental health professional. The Devil upright in a health context can also indicate a silent illness like high blood pressure. If you have been feeling unwell or inexplicably exhausted, go to the doctor and get a check-up. If you have a diagnosed illness, The Devil tells you not to let it define you, while you may have some restrictions be careful that you are not putting excessive limitations on yourself out of fear of exasperating your illness.
Spirituality (Upright)
In a spiritual context, The Devil can indicate that you have become too materialistic. Try to bring the focus back to the non-materialistic pleasures in life such as spending time with the people who make you happy or connecting to your spiritual side. It can also indicate that a lack of hope may be holding you back from moving towards the light. Like attracts like, so even in your darkest moments you should always strive to send light and love out into the world as that’s what you will attract back. Never allow darkness to take over. If you have felt overwhelmed with depression or anxiety, firstly make sure you surround yourself with a loving and supportive network of friends and let go of anybody who is overly negative or critical of you. Secondly, try some sort of energy healing to help you get rid of any negative energy you have been holding onto.

Reversed Meaning Guide
The Devil Reversed Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Detachment, independence, overcoming addiction, freedom, revelation, reclaiming power, reasserting control
General meaning and interpretation (Reversed)
In a general context, The Devil reversed can signify that you are becoming aware of the things that have been trapping you and the role you play in allowing them to. It is a great card for anyone battling an addiction or mental illness or engaging in harmful behaviour as it indicates that you are starting to see the light and take back control of yourself and your life. You want to be free from these problems and you are starting to get the motivation to change your circumstances. It can also indicate that you are getting a new perspective on issues that you felt powerless to change previously. The changes you want to make may not be easy but they are necessary for you if you want to have a happy life in the future and you are beginning to realise what you have to do. The Devil Tarot card reversed can also indicate a near miss with a negative, harmful or dangerous situation or person. The important message this Major Arcana card brings is to be grateful that you avoided it, learn from it and move forward. Do not fall back into the old bad or risky behaviours that led you so close to danger. Don’t get cocky and think you are invincible if you managed to dodge the bullet. Appreciate your good fortune, but don’t push it!
Love & Relationships (Reversed)
If you are in a relationship, The Devil Tarot card reversed can indicate that you and your partner may have been feeling stuck in a rut or felt like the relationship was on its way out but you having started to come out the other side of this. It can also be an indicator of a close call, one of you may have come close to doing something that would have irreparably damaged your relationship (e.g. an affair or infidelity) but decided to honour your relationship instead. If you have been in an abusive relationship, you may be beginning to realise that you deserve better and to take back your power. The influence your abusive partner once had over you may be lessening as you start to realise that you have choices and there is help out there for you. If you are single, The Devil reversed can indicate a close call with the type of negative, abusive or dangerous person described in the upright meaning. It can also indicate that previously you may have felt you were stuck with being single or were so desperately seeking someone to love you that you were prepared to put up anything. However, you are starting to become more aware of yourself and how this behaviour has been hindering your search for love. You may need to take a step back from dating for while to just start enjoying the freedom of only having yourself to answer to that being single brings. With this new attitude emerging, the right partner won’t be far behind so relax and enjoy this time.
Money & Career (Reversed)
In a career context, The Devil reversed shows that your awareness of how your behaviour and choices have influenced your current circumstances is increasing dramatically and you are ready to start taking steps to get to where you want to be. While you may have felt stuck in your job due to financial constraints or being too focused on attaining status or materialistic goals, you are starting to see the big picture and refocus on what is going to make you happy and fulfilled in your life. Seize this new motivation and don’t fall back into old habits because they are comfortable or offer more financial security. Financially speaking, if you have been engaging in gambling, excessive spending or risky behaviours with money, you are starting to regain control of yourself.
Health (Reversed)
In a health Tarot spread, The Devil reversed is a good omen as it indicates stopping harmful habits and starting on the road to recovery so if you have suffered from any sort of addiction, you may well be getting the strength to overcome it. Stay strong and focused. It can also signify that you are starting to overcome stress, anxiety and any mental health issues that may have been causing issues in the past. It’s important to keep moving forward and to keep the momentum going with this new lease of life you’ve been given. Don’t fall back in to old patterns.
Spirituality (Reversed)
As with the general meaning, The Devil Tarot card reversed can indicate that you have managed to avert a dangerous or harmful situation. In a spiritual Tarot spread, this tells you that the universe has been kind enough to allow you to learn your lesson without major negative consequences. You must learn this lesson now and learn it well or it will come back to you. The Devil reversed can also indicate that you are turning away from darkness and coming back to the light. This may signify you emerging from a period of depression, sadness or feeling spiritually lost to once again move towards love and light and reconnect with your higher consciousness. It may also signify that you are learning to deflect the negative energy of people around you so it no longer affects you in the way it once did.


  - The Tower

Upright Meaning Guide
The Tower Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Chaos, destruction, sudden upheaval, trauma, unexpected change, disaster, loss, tragedy, revelations, confusion, pain, divorce, abuse, violence, bankruptcy, natural disasters
Ad ends in 12
General Meaning and Interpretation (Upright)
Whereas the Death card is usually the card people are terrified of, out of all of the cards in the deck, The Tower is the one you really need to brace yourself for. The Tower Tarot card represents chaos and destruction. It is the Major Arcana card of sudden upheaval and unexpected change. This change usually is scary, life changing and often unavoidable. A negative Tower event can be akin to a bomb going off in your life. You don’t know how you will survive but somehow you will and later you will realise that while it was a tremendously difficult thing to go through and you wouldn’t wish it on your worst enemy, it has made you into the person you are. One positive aspect of The Tower is that the destruction it brings is usually directed at something that was built on a false beliefs and foundations or unrealistic goals and dreams. Also on the bright side, the destruction The Tower brings is always followed by renewal and creation. However, The Tower with a negative aspect can represent a whole host of tragic, traumatic or life-altering events like the death of a loved one, divorce, a bad breakup, assault, sexual assault, violence, abuse, stillbirth or miscarriage, bankruptcy, a drug overdose, a car crash or job loss to name but a few. It’s usually the kind of thing you hope will never happen to you. That said, not every Tower event denotes tragedy. If the surrounding cards are positive, The Tower can simply represent a big change, like going to live in another country. This will be a massive upheaval. It will be a scary adjustment and will change your life as you know it but ultimately the change will be a good one. Placement of The Tower is important too, in a past position in a Tarot spread it is telling you what you’ve been through. While there are some life-events that we cannot avoid, sometimes The Tower will appear in a future if you are on a path that is leading to danger to warn you to avoid it. For instance, if you tend to put yourself in dangerous situations without thinking of the consequences, The Tower may be a warning to be mindful of your safety. Or if you take big gambles with money, The Tower may be warning you that it’s time to start acting more responsibly to avert disaster. It can also warn of natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes etc.
Love & Relationships (Upright) 
In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, The Tower can be a bad omen representing, break-ups, separation or divorce. It can also represent either you or your partner or both, going through a difficult or traumatic event that will push your relationship to its absolute limits. If you want your relationship to survive this Tower event, you will need to try to be there for each other and maintain open and honest communication. If your relationship survives this upheaval, The Tower tells you that the relationship will have changed significantly. This may not necessarily be a bad thing as The Tower represents destruction of false beliefs too, so the relationship may come out completely changed but with a more solid and honest foundation. However, getting to that point will be one of the most difficult things you will go through as a couple. If you are single, you may find that you suddenly have to face an uncomfortable revelation about why you are single. If ego or arrogance has been getting in the way of you forming healthy relationships, it may indicate that a chaotic or destructive event is going to break down that ego. While this will not be a pleasant experience, it will teach you humility and improve your chances of a happy, healthy relationship in the future. The Tower can also indicate violence or assault so it can be a warning to be mindful of your personal safety when getting out there and meeting new people. Don’t be overly cautious but have your wits about you and take appropriate safety precautions.
Money & Career (Upright)
In a career context, The Tower may indicate a lack of job security. It can be a signifier of a redundancy or job loss. However, it may also indicate a big change in your current position which will bring you unwelcome stress and may prove difficult but could ultimately lead to a better position or more security. For instance, the company you work for could be bought over by another company which could cause you a lot of stress or uncertainty for a while but may eventually lead to a more secure job. Financially speaking, The Tower warns to you to be careful with money. In its extreme negative, The Tower can represent bankruptcy. Avoid risky investments. There may be an unexpected upheaval coming in financial terms so if you haven’t put any money aside for a rainy day, you’d better do so quickly.
Health (Upright)
In a health context, The Tower can represent a sudden illness or an accident so be mindful of your safety and well-being. If coupled with pregnancy cards it can indicate a difficult pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion or stillbirth. The Tower can also indicate mental health problems, which is understandable as Tower events generally bring with them extreme emotional turmoil. While the health issues The Tower represents are by no means easy, they are usually followed by a period of renewal. If health problems you are experiencing are forcing you to make changes in your life, try to go with the flow as these changes may ultimately prove to be for your best. Try to embrace them with a positive attitude. If you engage in any kind of substance abuse, The Tower is warning you to stop immediately or you may overdose.
Spirituality (Upright)
Imagine having a home you thought was solidly built and would shelter you for the rest of your life. The Tower would be a big storm that reduces your house to rubble, destroying everything you thought was secure and showing you that the foundations were not as solid as you once believed they were. While you would still have to experience sadness, loss, grief, anger and confusion at this horrible turn of events, out of the rubble you have the chance to build a new better home with more solid foundations. The Tower in a spiritual context represents the destruction of old beliefs. This could be a personal crisis of faith or some sort of scandal or revelation which will force you to rethink your whole belief system. Remember that the destruction of The Tower brings with it renewal so you may find that this sudden change actually opens you up to a more spiritual path in the long run, one that is based on a solid foundation of truth.

Reversed Meaning Guide
The Tower Reversed Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Resisting change, averting disaster, avoiding tragedy, delaying the inevitable, avoiding loss
General meaning and interpretation (Reversed)
The Tower Tarot card reversed can be a sign that you have narrowly avoided a disaster. You will need to learn from the experience in order to prevent the lesson from coming back around again. It can also signify delaying the inevitable. While we would all like to go through life without experiencing hardships, they are a necessary part of life. Without darkness how would we ever learn to appreciate the light? If you have been running from a big change because you fear the pain or heartache it will bring, this Major Arcana card in reversed position may be telling you it’s time to turn and face it. Avoiding it may seem like the easier option but if you do you’ll be running for the rest of your life. Confronting it won’t be easy but it will eventually lead you to a new beginning. If you have already experienced your Tower event, The Tower reversed warns you not to try and rebuild what you had but to seek something new and better to build in place of what was destroyed as it was destroyed for a reason. You need to let it go and focus on creating something new. It can also be a sign that you are trying to hold onto people that are no longer supporting you in the way they once did. You need to let go of them and let them go their own way, so new people can come into your life.
Love & Relationships (Reversed)
In a love context, if you are in a relationship, The Tower reversed can signify that while you know your relationship is as good as over, you are avoiding actually ending it for fear of the pain it will bring. You may think you can paper over the cracks but this would be like putting a band aid on a gunshot wound. You need to face facts and understand that as long as you hold onto something that is broken you are preventing yourself from moving onto something better. If your relationship has recently come through a Tower event, different but intact, The Tower reversed is telling you not to try and get the relationship back to the way it was previously. Your relationship has changed because it needed to, you can’t go back. You need to decide if this new version of your relationship is something you want. If you are single, The Tower reversed can indicate that you have avoided a disastrous relationship with someone who was possibly dangerous, abusive or violent. It can also indicate that you are delaying or completely avoiding dealing with a traumatic or painful breakup. While you may think this approach is easier than facing up to what you’ve been through, it is actually stopping you from moving on your love life. Stop and face whatever you’re running from, learn what you can from it and then draw a line under it and leave it in the past where it belongs. It hard to move forward when you’re dragging a truck load of baggage behind you so deal with it and let it go.
Money & Career (Reversed)
In a career context, The Tower reversed can indicate that you may be managing to hold onto your job in difficult circumstances. This can be simply a sign that you are successfully avoiding a job loss. However, if you are avoiding something you perceive as a career disaster and rather than feel relieved you find yourself unhappy or dissatisfied, consider that this outcome may not actually be the best thing for you. Sometimes being out of our comfort zones can inspire us to do amazing things we never would have attempted otherwise. Financially, The Tower reversed is the same, it can indicate that you are averting a financial disaster but it does not necessarily mean that you should. It may be worth considering allowing whatever this negative event is, to just happen so you can deal with it and move forward, rather than constantly trying to push a boulder up a big hill and always struggling. For instance, being made redundant while scary, stressful and difficult for you, may give you the time and motivation to start your own business. Or if you have been struggling to make payments on a mortgage you can no longer afford to the detriment of every other area of your life, giving the keys back to the bank and renting might actually be a tough choice that would ultimately make you happier.
Health (Reversed)
In a Health context, The Tower reversed can indicate that you may be ignoring an illness or a warning sign of an illness, hoping it will go away. You need to face this head on to give yourself the best chance at recovery. It may also indicate that a health scare may turn out to be nothing serious, and as such, you have averted disaster. Whatever the case, burying your head in the sand will not do you any good in terms of health issues.
Spirituality (Reversed)
In a spiritual context, The Tower reversed indicates that you may have realised that the old beliefs that you once held dear are now proving to be false but you are resisting letting them go. Maybe you feel that if you don’t have those beliefs, you don’t know what to believe in. Maybe you fear backlash from others who still hold those beliefs and are afraid to break with the status quo. You need to face the truth, let go of that which is not working for you in order to move forward and find your true spiritual path. This will not be easy but it will be worth it in the end.

Reversed Meaning Guide
The Star Reversed Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Hopelessness, despair, focusing on the negative, lack of faith, lack of inspiration, lack of creativity, boredom, monotony
General meaning and interpretation (Reversed)
The Star in a reversed position can indicate that you are feeling hopeless. Perhaps the difficult situations you have been through in the past have drained you of your lust for life and your faith in the universe’s plan for you. The Star reversed does not indicate that things are hopeless, only that you feel they are. You need to take responsibility for yourself and your attitude to life. You may want to consider seeking some professional counselling to help you heal the wounds of the past and leave them where they belong. The Star can signify that you have lost your confidence, your belief in yourself and your trust in your own abilities. This Major Arcana card can also be an indication of feeling anxious and overwhelmed. A change of attitude is needed to resolve this not necessarily a change of circumstances. Don’t allow yourself to continue to play the victim if you have long since left the situation in which you were victimised. The Star is telling you that it’s time to heal the past, draw a line under it and move forward. Seek support to do this if you need to. You can do anything you set your mind to, you just have to believe in yourself and focus on the positive. Start small and try to find one or two things to be grateful for in each day. A creative outlet might also be helpful to you if you are artistically inclined. Rediscover your creative side, it will help you heal.
Love & Relationships (Reversed)
If you are in a relationship, The Star reversed indicates that you may have lost faith in the relationship or are focusing on the negative and missing the positive aspects of your relationship. Your relationship may have lost some of its spark, you may feel that the relationship has become stagnant and monotonous and that you and your partner have disconnected on some level. The Star reversed tells you that these problems can be fixed but you have to be prepared to heal old wounds and clear out any negative energy from the relationship if you want to go forward. If you are single, The Star reversed indicates loneliness and lack of faith in the universe’s plan for you. You may be feeling like you will never meet the right person for you. You may feel that you are becoming cynical about love. You need to release your fears and let go of the negative energy you’ve been holding on to in order to move forward. Love will appear when you least expect it!
Money & Career (Reversed)
In a career Tarot spread, The Star reversed indicates that you may be feeling bored in your career or feel that you are stuck in a career that is going nowhere. Monotony has set in and you no longer feel the creative spark or enthusiasm you once had. You need to change your attitude and start focusing on the positive. Things are not as bad as they seem and anything you are unhappy with is within your power to change. The Star reversed can also indicate that you are not using your creativity and are letting your talents go to waste. In a financial context, if your finances have not been going well, The Star reversed tells you that any problems are within your power to change. Reassess your financial plans in light of any recent changes in your circumstances and ask yourself are these plans still working for you and will they get you what you want? If not, look at what you can do to change them to suit your current circumstances. Don’t let anxiety over money overwhelm you, it’s not all doom and gloom! Things are not as bad as you think they are.
Health (Reversed)
In a health context, The Star reversed can indicate that your health is not all that bad but any issues you have will be magnified by your anxiety and pessimism at the moment. You may be worrying about your health and blowing any symptoms way out of proportion rather than going for a simple check-up. Try to focus on the positive. If you are worried about a health issue, go and get it checked by a doctor to put your mind at ease. Energy healing may be beneficial to you at the moment to boost your health and help you to let go of any negative energy you’re holding onto.
Spirituality (Reversed)
The Star reversed in a spiritual context shows that you have lost faith in the universe. You may feel like you are disconnected from spirit and you may be looking upon the difficulties you have faced in the past as an indication that you are doomed. Remember, the universe loves you. Even when you are going through terribly tough times, it is simply the universe giving you an opportunity to learn and grow. Reconnect to your spiritual side and try to find something to be grateful for in each day. You will not believe the difference such a small change can make to your outlook on life.

Intuition, illusion, dreams, vagueness, instability, deception, anxiety, fear, misconception, subconscious, insecurity
General Meaning and Interpretation (Upright)
The general meaning of The Moon Tarot card in an upright position is that everything is not as it seems. It is also the Major Arcana Tarot card of intuition. The Moons tells you that something about a situation or person in your life is not what it appears to be and you need to trust what your instincts are telling you in order to see past this illusion.

General meaning and interpretation (Reversed)
In a general context, The Sun Tarot card reversed can indicate sadness, depression and pessimism. You may be finding it difficult to focus on the positive with this card in your Tarot reading. The Sun reversed does not usually mean that your situation or circumstances are all that bad but that you are feeling pessimistic and focusing on the negative which is affecting your outlook on life. It can signify a lack of enthusiasm for life, being unclear on the right path to take or being unable to see the way forward. This Major Arcana card may show that you are letting negative energy/thoughts close you off to the happiness and joy that is all around you. You have the power to change this by simply allowing yourself to be open to the positive things that are coming your way and by finding gratitude for the good things in your life. The Sun reversed can also be an indicator of being overly enthusiastic or confident to the point that it becomes a negative trait.

Alternately, it can indicate that you may have set unrealistic career goals or may not be taking the appropriate practical steps to achieve what you want but relying on positivity alone to get you there. It can also indicate that you work in a cut-throat environment where being egotistical or competitive may be more valued. In a financial Tarot spread, The Sun reversed can be a bad omen.

The Judgement Tarot card reversed can also indicate issues caused by failure to learn from the past. Perhaps you and your partner have been through a rough patch and you feel like you should be closer now but you’re not. Ask yourself have you learned all you could from those past issues and are you applying that knowledge to your relationship? If you are single, Judgement reversed can indicate that you are letting shyness or embarrassment stop you from approaching the person you are interested in. Don’t let fear hold you back! Whether or not it works out the way you want it to, at least you’ll know you tried and you won’t have to forever wonder “what if?”
Money & Career (Reversed)

This is not a time for indecisiveness. You need to seize the opportunities available to you. If you let them slip by you may regret it. In a financial context, don’t be overly cautious with money. That’s not to suggest you should go wild and blow all your money at a casino but loosening the purse strings a little bit won’t kill you. You may find yourself deliberating endlessly about every purchase, if it’s something you need and you can afford it, just buy it! It’s good to be financially responsible but you don’t have to fret about every penny you spend.
Health (Reversed)
In a health context, if you suffer from a long-term illness or injury, Judgement reversed may be telling you to let go of any old negativity especially if it’s relating to someone who may have caused or contributed to your injury or illness. Holding onto negativity will only make your recovery more difficult. You have to accept where you are and let go of the past if you want to move forward.
Spirituality (Reversed)
In a spiritual context, Judgement reversed signifies that you are missing or refusing to learn your karmic lessons. If you don’t learn them the universe will bring them back to you bigger and bolder. Give yourself time to absorb these lessons so you can move forward in a positive way.

Reversed Meaning Guide
The World Reversed Tarot Card Key Meanings:
Lack of success, stagnation, lack of achievement, disappointment, burden, lack of completion
General meaning and interpretation (Reversed)
In a general context, The World Tarot card reversed can indicate that you have not accomplished what you set out to do and things have become stagnant. You may have tried to take shortcuts instead of putting in the hard work necessary to achieve your dreams. You may be throwing all your energy into trying to make something work that is not working for you. The World reversed can signify feeling stuck in a situation. This will be one particular part of your life that is taking up your energy rather than problems in all areas. You may be aware of what is it already as it will be a focus for you and you may feel burdened by it. Remember that there is no point in flogging a dead horse. So if you’ve thrown everything you’ve got a something and it’s still not working for you, The World reversed may be telling you that it’s time to accept the disappointment and cut your losses.
Love & Relationships (Reversed)
In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship, The World reversed can indicate that your relationship has become stagnant. It may be that you and your partner have let things slide and you need to put more effort in to the relationship and having open and honest communication to get it back on track. If, however, you have been putting serious work into your relationship but it doesn’t seem to be getting any better, you may need to consider if this is the right relationship for you. If you are single, you may feel that your love life has fallen flat but ask yourself if you’ve been making enough effort to get out and meet the right people. Prince/Princess charming is not just going to knock on your door and sweep you off your feet. You have to get out and meet people. Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there. The World reversed can also indicate that you are struggling to move on from a relationship that ended without warning. Perhaps a previous partner suddenly cut you off without warning or didn’t give you the time you needed to come to terms with the end of relationship. This can be incredibly difficult to deal with as you have not had an opportunity to get closure. Don’t wish your life away waiting for them to come back. You may never get closure from your previous partner so you must focus on finding another way to make your peace with what has happened. Ask the universe to help you in this and keep yourself open to opportunities for healing. You will get through it in time but it will take a big conscious effort on your part, so put your focus into that.
Money & Career (Reversed)
In a career context, The World reversed can indicate that you have not reached the career goals you have set for yourself. It can also signify that you are falling short of your potential. Ask yourself what is holding you back? Have you putting the effort in? Are you afraid to strive to be all you can be for fear of failure? Are you stuck in a career that does not fulfil you? Remember you are the master of your own destiny. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, mistakes are how we learn. And don’t be afraid to think outside the box or take an unconventional career path if it’s what you love to do. In a financial Tarot spread, The World Tarot card reversed can indicate that your finances have become stagnant. There are always things you can do to help yourself. Don’t try to take shortcuts or engage in risky investments or get rich quick schemes to boost your bank balance. Hard work, consistency and determination are needed to get you into a comfortable financial position.
Health (Reversed)
In a health context, if you have been suffering from an illness, The World reversed can indicate that you need to rethink your treatments. If you have been trying the same things over and over and they have not been working, The World reversed is telling to try something different. This does not mean ignore your doctor’s advice but maybe try a holistic approach in conjunction with your current treatments that will compliment them and boost your health. However, if you have been failing to complete treatments like a course of medication or complete a fitness plan, The World reversed tells you to stop trying to take shortcuts and finish what you’ve started, if you want to resolve your health issues.
Spirituality (Reversed)
In a spiritual context, The World reversed indicates that you may feel your spirit connection has become stagnant and that you are unable or have lost the will to progress. When this happens sometimes we need to try a different approach. Why not try something you’ve never tried before? Try something new and interesting to reignite your passion. Alternatively, if you have not been putting the work into your spiritual pursuits, it tells you to be honest with yourself. There are no shortcuts to your spiritual path. You have to want to follow the path and put the effort in.
