Ad ends in 12
General Meaning and Interpretation (Upright)
In a general context, the Two of Swords represents a stalemate, truce or being at a crossroads. It indicates that you are sitting on the fence or struggling to make/ avoiding a difficult, stressful or painful decision. It is the Minor Arcana of coming face to face with your fears. It can also signify being torn between two loyalties, relationships, situations, offers or people. It represents being caught in the middle of an argument or conflict and trying to mediate between opposing parties. The Two of Swords also represents blocking emotions, being in denial, blindness and an inability or unwillingness to see the truth.
Love & Relationships (Upright) 
In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Two of Swords can indicate a stalemate or a relationship at a crossroads. It may be that you and your partner have been arguing frequently lately or cannot agree on an important relationship decision and have called a temporary truce. You may simply need a bit of time and space to consider the pros and cons of the matter and how you can come to an agreement. You may simply be reluctant to make a decision on this matter as you risk being vulnerable. However, it can also indicate that a painful choice needs to be made regarding the future of the relationship but you are both sitting on the fence because of the pain the decision will bring. This Minor Arcana card can also signify being torn between two relationships. Whatever the case, you need to face your fears and make a decision so that everyone concerned can move forward in their lives either together or separately. If you are single, the Two of Swords can indicate you have a choice between two potential partners and this choice may be causing you great difficulty. However, the choice does need to be made for the good of all concerned as it is unfair to keep stringing them along. Alternatively, it can mean that you are avoiding letting someone know you are interested for fear of rejection.
Money & Career (Upright)
In a career Tarot reading, the Two of Swords indicates that you may be caught in the middle of a conflict at work. You may be asked to choose between two colleagues with opposing views. This will be difficult and stressful for you as you do not want to appear disloyal to either of them but they are unwilling to meet in the middle. It can also signify that you are torn between two career paths or positions. This Minor Arcana card can also indicate that you are in denial or unable to see the entire truth of the situation. So be aware that you may not have all the facts you may need more information before you can make an informed decision. Try to get more facts and weigh up the pros and cons of each option, if you are struggling to figure out your next right move. In a financial context, again the Two of Swords represents difficult or stressful choices and an inability or unwillingness to see the truth. If you are having financial problems at the moment, you cannot allow yourself to be in denial about them. You may have to make some tough choices to weather the storm such as downsizing your car or tightening your belt but you can do it. Sticking your head in the sand will only add to your problems. Get professional financial advice if you are unsure of your options.
Health (Upright)
In a health context, the Two of Swords indicates that blocked unexpressed emotions may be at the centre of any health issues or physical discomfort you are experiencing. Blocked emotions or holding on to anxiety or resentment can block the chakras (energy centres in the body) leading to physical manifestations in the form of illnesses and injuries. If you are experiencing physical issues, as well as seeking appropriate care from a medical professional, you should also consider what steps you can to take to release the emotions blocking that area.
Spirituality (Upright)
In a spirituality context, the Two of Swords indicates that your spiritual path is not clear to you at the moment. Finding the balance within you is the key here. When you find your own balance, you learn to tune out all the outside interference and tune into your own wisdom. If you can do this your correct path will become clear to you.

General meaning and interpretation (Reversed)
In a general context, the Two of Swords reversed represents indecision, delays or postponement. It indicates that fear, worry, anxiety or stress is overwhelming you and you may be experiencing emotional or mental turmoil as a result leading to an inability to make a decision. It can also represent holding onto resentment or anxiety and being overloaded with more information that you can handle.

Love & Relationships (Reversed)
In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship, the Two of Swords reversed indicates that you may be experiencing emotional turmoil about a decision you need to make regarding your relationship leading you to become completely indecisive. Anxiety or fear may be overwhelming you to the point that you are emotionally detaching from your partner rather than deal with the issues at hand. It also signify holding onto anxiety, problems or resentment. It may be that you are papering over the cracks in your relationship rather than dealing things and drawing a line under them, which leads to resentment. Alternatively, it can also represent finally seeing the truth of a situation after a period of being unable to move forward. If that is the case, you can now take steps in a positive direction but do so gentle at a pace that is comfortable for you and your partner, don’t force it. If you are single, the Two of Swords reversed can indicate that you may be experiencing overwhelming anxiety regarding dating which may be causing you to avoid it altogether. Perhaps you haven’t dated in a while and feel like you are out of practice or perhaps you are still processing the emotional turmoil from your last relationship or holding onto some resentment and aren’t quite ready to move forward yet. Don’t avoid the situation but be gentle with yourself. Get out and meet people without putting too much pressure on yourself to start something if you are not ready yet. Be patient and ease yourself into it. For instance, you could have casual low-key dates until you feel more comfortable such as meeting your date for a coffee or inviting your date along to a party so that it’s not a one-on-one situation.
Money & Career (Reversed)
In a career Tarot reading, the Two of Swords reversed indicates that a conflict at work may be causing you an overwhelming amount of stress or anxiety. It can indicate delays or postponements of projects or promotions. Alternatively, it can indicate that you are able to see a work problem clearly where you were blind to it before and you will be able to take positive steps to resolve it. This Minor Arcana reversed can indicate the truth being exposed so dodgy deals or corrupt practices may come to light that you were not aware of before. Be careful in this situation and make sure you don’t get dragged into the mud along with the culprits. In a financial context, if you have been struggling financially, the Two of Swords reversed indicates that you may be starting to realise the truth of your situation, which is a good first step to resolving it. You need to be practical and balanced in your approach. Look realistically at where you can save money or cut costs and do it.
Health (Reversed)
In a health context, the Two of Swords reversed indicates that you may be struggling with finding a healthy balance in between your emotions and your mind, which may be the root of any health issues. Overwhelming anxiety, worry or stress you could be leading to a collection of physical symptoms or just generally not feeling your best.
Spirituality (Reversed)
In a spirituality context, the Two of Swords reversed tells you that while it is good to familiarise yourself with information on spiritual practices, there is such thing as information overload! Don’t make your spiritual path a purely academic exercise by reading every book there is to read on every spiritual practice every conceived. You have so much wisdom inside yourself.

The most difficult situations in our lives often teach us more about who we are and what we are capable of than the good times. Give yourself space and time to heal and learn all you can from the experience. If you need support, don’t be afraid to reach out to the people that love you.
Love & Relationships (Upright) 
In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Three of Swords is not a great omen as it represents tears, heartache, heartbreak, sorrow and conflict. This does not have to mean the end of your relationship but it does strongly indicate that there are some difficult issues that need to be addressed in order for the relationship to survive. You need to sit down with your partner and have an open and honest discussion about how you feel and respectfully listen to each other. Descending into arguments, nasty comments or recriminations will only cause the situation to worsen. You may have become unhappy or disillusioned with the relationship or there may simply be a lack of communication between you and your partner leading to serious misunderstandings between the two of you and a sense of alienation or loneliness in the relationship. The Three of Swords can indicate a breakup, divorce or separation and the legal matters associated with such events.

In a career Tarot spread, the Three of Swords represents stress, disillusionment or losses so it is not a great omen. This Minor Arcana card can signify the grief and loss experienced due to the sudden loss of a job or redundancy. It can also represent becoming disillusioned with your career or prospects. It may also indicate breakdowns of communication, arguments or strike action at work as it is a card of division and conflict. Whatever the case, it is generally an indication that your career is causing a lot of grief in your life at the moment. If you are experiencing conflicts in the workplace try to have a respectful, open and honest conversation with the parties concerned to resolve it. Listen to their concerns as well as voicing your own. If you have suffered a job loss, try to make the most of the free time you have by doing the things you normally wouldn’t have time for. It is important to stay positive and realise that career is just one aspect of your life, don’t let any issues in that area overshadow the other areas of your life. In a financial context, the Three of Swords is not a great omen as it can indicate a loss and upheaval. You may have suffered a financial loss, or an emotional loss which has financial consequences such for example a divorce or separation. Things may not have worked out the way you hoped but now is not the time to stick you head in the sand. You need to come up with a step by step plan for managing your finances. Take it one task at a time and you will come through this.
Health (Upright)
In a health Tarot reading, the Three of Swords is not a great omen as it can indicate ill-health, surgery and disorders.

It can also be an indication of cardiac issues. However, this card can also be associated with anxiety, depression and trauma so it may be an indication that any physical health issues may be manifesting as a result of deeper emotional or mental health issues. Whatever the case, taking care of your mental and emotional health at this time will be extremely important to your recovery, so be kind to yourself and try to keep a positive outlook.
Spirituality (Upright)
In a spiritual context, the Three of Swords indicates that you are in need of healing. Recent events or losses have left you feeling bereft and sorrowful. You may feel there is little consolation to be had at this time. However, it is often out our greatest sorrows that give us the biggest opportunities to grow, learn and evolve as spiritual beings. Reach out to people you trust for support at this time and allow yourself the time you need to grieve the loss you have experienced. Be open to the messages your spirit guides are sending you, they are there to guide you through this storm.

Your partner may have betrayed or hurt you in the past and you are continuing to focus on this and feel unable to forgive them. If that is the case, you need to ask yourself if there is any point in continuing the relationship. Your relationship will not be able to grow while you are holding onto past indiscretions. This doesn’t mean you pretend that it never happened but you can’t keep using it as an emotional stick to beat your partner with, even if they did cause pain and sorrow in your life. You need to figure out if you can draw a line under the past and move forward together. If you can’t it may be time to let them go so you can both move on to a something healthier.

You may be feeling much more upbeat and your work environment may be much more positive and happy. Perhaps the person who was causing the stress has left the company. Communication has improved and there is an atmosphere of reconciliation, compromise and forgiveness. Alternatively, this Minor Arcana card in reverse can signify an already difficult work situation getting worse. Lots of previous upheaval and the bad feeling that has caused is made worse by people being unwilling to let go of negativity or choosing to hold grudges rather than draw a line under things and move forward in a productive way. In a financial context, the Three of Swords reversed can indicate that you are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel after a period of financial difficulty. You may be coming to a compromise with lenders to pay back a debt or they may agree some level of debt forgiveness. You may be reaching out for support or help with your financial problems and you should be feeling much more positive when it appears in your Tarot spread. Alternatively, this card can indicate a severe level of wallowing in a financial loss. You may have lost a job you loved or lost your home or financial status due to the recession. This card suggests that you are still holding onto the memories of what once was, unwilling to accept where you are today. You need to accept your situation and begin to take real steps to improve it, rather than wallowing in self-pity.
Health (Reversed)
In a health Tarot reading, the Three of Swords reversed can signify a return to health after a period of ill-health, surgery or disorders. You should be feeling much more optimistic about your chances of recovering or healing. Alternatively, this card in reverse may be telling you that anxiety levels are playing a major part in any health problems you are experiencing. Do not allow your fear to overwhelm you, seek professional help if you need to.
Spirituality (Reversed)

Try meditation or Reiki to help heal the sorrow and allow the guidance your spirit guides are sending you to enter your heart.
